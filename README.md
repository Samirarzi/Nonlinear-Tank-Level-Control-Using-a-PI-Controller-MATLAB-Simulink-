# Nonlinear-Tank-Level-Control-Using-a-PI-Controller-MATLAB-Simulink-
Overview  This project implements and simulates a nonlinear liquid-level control of a single tank in MATLAB/Simulink. The plant is nonlinear because the outflow depends on the square root of the liquid height. A PI controller is used in a feedback loop to regulate the level to a desired setpoint.
